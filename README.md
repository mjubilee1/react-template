# Getting Started

This is a React template starter project developed by Montrell Jubilee. It includes custom-built components using Tailwind CSS and TypeScript.

1. Clone Repo
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Once you have run `yarn install`, install nvm and run the command `nvm use` to make sure you are using the version of node specified in the package.json and .nvmrc file
4. If you don't already have the TSLint Plugin, install the TSLint plugin in VSCode. That should work with the TS settings configured in the tsconfig.json file
5. You should be all set. I encourage you to purge/remove all unused icons and components you do not intend on using to decrease the overall build size. The reason I have so many icons and UI components is because this repo is intended to be a very good starting template.
6. `yarn start` will start up the application
7. Take a look at the tailwind.config.js file and customize your primary and secondary colors for your theming

# Scripts

`yarn storybook` will run the Storybook UI library so you can have a playground for the components in the components/UI directory. Customize your UI components as you see fit.
